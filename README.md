# What this repo is, and isn't

This repo contains the proposed spec for soulscript. This is not a client library for soulgraph (those are forthcoming in separate repos), but an effort to rally the wider developer community to settle on a standardized, framework-agnostic approach to defining agent personalities.

You can try out our implmentation of soulscript, today, in the playground on https://soulgra.ph.

# Why does this need to exist?
